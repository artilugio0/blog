Hello! I am Artilugio, a passionate programmer with a keen interest in security, mathematics, and cryptography. I have been involved in the tech community professionally for over 15 years, where I have developed my skills in backend development, application security, and cloud environments, cryptography, and infrastructure.

I love sharing my knowledge, which is why my aim is to use my blog, streams, and videos to make complex topics accessible to everyone.

When I'm not coding or learning, I enjoy playing the guitar, exercising, and reading.

I'm always interested in discussing any tech-related topic and eager to learn about new subjects.
